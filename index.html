            <p>
                My name is Yulin, a software QA engineer working in Chicago Loop area. 
                I graduated from college two years ago. And now I'm a student of Northwestern 
                Coding BootCamp 2018. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This time, I'm looking forward to become a full stuck developer by taking 
                part in this program and making unremitting efforts. To achieve the goal, 
                I need to spend more time no practice not only in class, but also after school.
